# First time setup

Matlab version R2022b used to run project code, newer releases should also work.


The following toolboxes may be needed for some code files:
- Communications
- Curve fitting
- DSP System
- Parallel computing
- Signal Processing
- Statistics and Machine Learning
- Symbolic Math


Add the 'src/common files' folder to the matlab path.
